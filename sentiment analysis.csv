"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life

"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days. Would recommend","overall it’s a great phone. came in great condition. the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. barely even noticeable. both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but i’m also not using a fast charger like i’m use to. overall great phone and quick shipping. i received the phone in 3 days. would recommend",overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little skuff barely even noticeable cameras work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable im also using fast charger like im use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little stuff barely even noticeable camera work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable in also using fast charge like in use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,"['overall', 'great', 'phone', 'came', 'great', 'condition', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'barely', 'little', 'stuff', 'barely', 'even', 'noticeable', 'camera', 'work', 'expected', 'sounds', 'work', 'fully', 'unlocked', 'problem', 'getting', 'hooked', 'boost', 'plan', 'complaint', 'battery', 'health', '84', 'makes', 'charging', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'desirable', 'in', 'also', 'using', 'fast', 'charge', 'like', 'in', 'use', 'overall', 'great', 'phone', 'quick', 'shipping', 'received', 'phone', '3', 'days', 'would', 'recommend']",overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl less desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend,overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl le desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend
"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days. Would recommend","overall it’s a great phone. came in great condition. the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. barely even noticeable. both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but i’m also not using a fast charger like i’m use to. overall great phone and quick shipping. i received the phone in 3 days. would recommend",overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little skuff barely even noticeable cameras work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable im also using fast charger like im use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little stuff barely even noticeable camera work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable in also using fast charge like in use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,"['overall', 'great', 'phone', 'came', 'great', 'condition', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'barely', 'little', 'stuff', 'barely', 'even', 'noticeable', 'camera', 'work', 'expected', 'sounds', 'work', 'fully', 'unlocked', 'problem', 'getting', 'hooked', 'boost', 'plan', 'complaint', 'battery', 'health', '84', 'makes', 'charging', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'desirable', 'in', 'also', 'using', 'fast', 'charge', 'like', 'in', 'use', 'overall', 'great', 'phone', 'quick', 'shipping', 'received', 'phone', '3', 'days', 'would', 'recommend']",overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl less desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend,overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl le desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend
"I’ve ordered from this seller a few times now and each time my orders have gotten to me in a very timely manner, this time right before my surgery which is when I needed my new phone, and the past orders had come in with pretty much no cosmetic damage to them at all and looked as if they were brand new.It’s almost the exact same thing with this phone, except this one’s battery life is a lot poorer than the other phones I’ve ordered from this seller and it’s honestly slightly disappointing since the battery on this phone depletes so much quicker than the other phones.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one.

"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days. Would recommend","overall it’s a great phone. came in great condition. the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. barely even noticeable. both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but i’m also not using a fast charger like i’m use to. overall great phone and quick shipping. i received the phone in 3 days. would recommend",overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little skuff barely even noticeable cameras work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable im also using fast charger like im use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little stuff barely even noticeable camera work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable in also using fast charge like in use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,"['overall', 'great', 'phone', 'came', 'great', 'condition', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'barely', 'little', 'stuff', 'barely', 'even', 'noticeable', 'camera', 'work', 'expected', 'sounds', 'work', 'fully', 'unlocked', 'problem', 'getting', 'hooked', 'boost', 'plan', 'complaint', 'battery', 'health', '84', 'makes', 'charging', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'desirable', 'in', 'also', 'using', 'fast', 'charge', 'like', 'in', 'use', 'overall', 'great', 'phone', 'quick', 'shipping', 'received', 'phone', '3', 'days', 'would', 'recommend']",overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl less desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend,overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl le desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed.

They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days.

"I’ve ordered from this seller a few times now and each time my orders have gotten to me in a very timely manner, this time right before my surgery which is when I needed my new phone, and the past orders had come in with pretty much no cosmetic damage to them at all and looked as if they were brand new.It’s almost the exact same thing with this phone, except this one’s battery life is a lot poorer than the other phones I’ve ordered from this seller and it’s honestly slightly disappointing since the battery on this phone depletes so much quicker than the other phones.  I could be wrong and if so, PLEASE correct me, but 80% I believe is the bare minimum before you’re advised into looking at getting a replacement battery, but I do not have the means or the funds to

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?","the 'minor visual blemishes' for me

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan.

"I’ve ordered from this seller a few times now and each time my orders have gotten to me in a very timely manner, this time right before my surgery which is when I needed my new phone, and the past orders had come in with pretty much no cosmetic damage to them at all and looked as if they were brand new.It’s almost the exact same thing with this phone, except this one’s battery life is a lot poorer than the other phones I’ve ordered from this seller and it’s honestly slightly disappointing since the battery on this phone depletes so much quicker than the other phones.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one.

"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days. Would recommend","overall it’s a great phone. came in great condition. the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. barely even noticeable. both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but i’m also not using a fast charger like i’m use to. overall great phone and quick shipping. i received the phone in 3 days. would recommend",overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little skuff barely even noticeable cameras work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable im also using fast charger like im use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little stuff barely even noticeable camera work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable in also using fast charge like in use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,"['overall', 'great', 'phone', 'came', 'great', 'condition', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'barely', 'little', 'stuff', 'barely', 'even', 'noticeable', 'camera', 'work', 'expected', 'sounds', 'work', 'fully', 'unlocked', 'problem', 'getting', 'hooked', 'boost', 'plan', 'complaint', 'battery', 'health', '84', 'makes', 'charging', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'desirable', 'in', 'also', 'using', 'fast', 'charge', 'like', 'in', 'use', 'overall', 'great', 'phone', 'quick', 'shipping', 'received', 'phone', '3', 'days', 'would', 'recommend']",overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl less desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend,overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl le desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend
"I’ve ordered from this seller a few times now and each time my orders have gotten to me in a very timely manner, this time right before my surgery which is when I needed my new phone, and the past orders had come in with pretty much no cosmetic damage to them at all and looked as if they were brand new.It’s almost the exact same thing with this phone, except this one’s battery life is a lot poorer than the other phones I’ve ordered from this seller and it’s honestly slightly disappointing since the battery on this phone depletes so much quicker than the other phones.

"For me my biggest worry was the battery life, I was very apprehensive at first but took a shot at it. I received my phone and was shocked to not only see the battery’s capacity was 85% but the great condition the phone came in. With the “good condition” iPhone I expected some noticeable scuffs and scratches but what I received was no where near that, had some scuff near the camera (not on lens) a minuscule almost abysmal scratch on the screen and that’s it. Overall I’m very very happy with my his phone. The quality of the restoration is fantastic.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life

"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed.

I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right?

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days. Would recommend","overall it’s a great phone. came in great condition. the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. barely even noticeable. both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but i’m also not using a fast charger like i’m use to. overall great phone and quick shipping. i received the phone in 3 days. would recommend",overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little skuff barely even noticeable cameras work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable im also using fast charger like im use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little stuff barely even noticeable camera work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable in also using fast charge like in use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,"['overall', 'great', 'phone', 'came', 'great', 'condition', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'barely', 'little', 'stuff', 'barely', 'even', 'noticeable', 'camera', 'work', 'expected', 'sounds', 'work', 'fully', 'unlocked', 'problem', 'getting', 'hooked', 'boost', 'plan', 'complaint', 'battery', 'health', '84', 'makes', 'charging', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'desirable', 'in', 'also', 'using', 'fast', 'charge', 'like', 'in', 'use', 'overall', 'great', 'phone', 'quick', 'shipping', 'received', 'phone', '3', 'days', 'would', 'recommend']",overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl less desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend,overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl le desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed.

They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?","the 'minor visual blemishes' for me

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days. Would recommend","overall it’s a great phone. came in great condition. the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. barely even noticeable. both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but i’m also not using a fast charger like i’m use to. overall great phone and quick shipping. i received the phone in 3 days. would recommend",overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little skuff barely even noticeable cameras work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable im also using fast charger like im use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little stuff barely even noticeable camera work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable in also using fast charge like in use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,"['overall', 'great', 'phone', 'came', 'great', 'condition', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'barely', 'little', 'stuff', 'barely', 'even', 'noticeable', 'camera', 'work', 'expected', 'sounds', 'work', 'fully', 'unlocked', 'problem', 'getting', 'hooked', 'boost', 'plan', 'complaint', 'battery', 'health', '84', 'makes', 'charging', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'desirable', 'in', 'also', 'using', 'fast', 'charge', 'like', 'in', 'use', 'overall', 'great', 'phone', 'quick', 'shipping', 'received', 'phone', '3', 'days', 'would', 'recommend']",overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl less desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend,overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl le desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%. Again, not sure how this measures up to a healthy unit, and can't tell you how thirsty it is under load, but for a unit in standby that feels like a normal drain?","the 'minor visual blemishes' for me

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days. Would recommend","overall it’s a great phone. came in great condition. the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. barely even noticeable. both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but i’m also not using a fast charger like i’m use to. overall great phone and quick shipping. i received the phone in 3 days. would recommend",overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall its a great phone came in great condition the bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it barely even noticeable both of the cameras work as expected all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so i had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan my only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84 which makes charging time a little less than desirable but im also not using a fast charger like im use to overall great phone and quick shipping i received the phone in 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little skuff barely even noticeable cameras work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable im also using fast charger like im use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,overall great phone came great condition bottom right corner barely little stuff barely even noticeable camera work expected sounds work fully unlocked problem getting hooked boost plan complaint battery health 84 makes charging time little less desirable in also using fast charge like in use overall great phone quick shipping received phone 3 days would recommend,"['overall', 'great', 'phone', 'came', 'great', 'condition', 'bottom', 'right', 'corner', 'barely', 'little', 'stuff', 'barely', 'even', 'noticeable', 'camera', 'work', 'expected', 'sounds', 'work', 'fully', 'unlocked', 'problem', 'getting', 'hooked', 'boost', 'plan', 'complaint', 'battery', 'health', '84', 'makes', 'charging', 'time', 'little', 'less', 'desirable', 'in', 'also', 'using', 'fast', 'charge', 'like', 'in', 'use', 'overall', 'great', 'phone', 'quick', 'shipping', 'received', 'phone', '3', 'days', 'would', 'recommend']",overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl less desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend,overal great phone came great condit bottom right corner bare littl stuff bare even notic camera work expect sound work fulli unlock problem get hook boost plan complaint batteri health 84 make charg time littl le desir in also use fast charg like in use overal great phone quick ship receiv phone 3 day would recommend
"I’ve ordered from this seller a few times now and each time my orders have gotten to me in a very timely manner, this time right before my surgery which is when I needed my new phone, and the past orders had come in with pretty much no cosmetic damage to them at all and looked as if they were brand new.It’s almost the exact same thing with this phone, except this one’s battery life is a lot poorer than the other phones I’ve ordered from this seller and it’s honestly slightly disappointing since the battery on this phone depletes so much quicker than the other phones.

"The 'minor visual blemishes' for me were that the edges of the case are a bit scuffed. I don't know if it's just paint peeling or if the refurbishing company polished it at all, but it's not rough to the touch or anything; just kinda spotted and not a smooth factory-new finish.Functionally, though, the phone is perfect. They replaced, I THINK, the display specifically? because in the settings menu there's a little warning that the 'screen may not be a certified part'. I mean, okay, not like I'm gonna try to get a warranty replacement on it, right? I've heard/read things about that if the camera(s) are replaced, FaceID and/or ARKit won't function, but at least for mine, THAT didn't seem to be an issue - works just fine.I don't know the standard/expected battery life, but I can say that I charged the phone overnight to 100% (indicated), and then left it turned on at home, connected to Wi-Fi in terms of using signal in any way; after about a 10-hour workday, when I came home, it was down to 85%.

"I ordered this phone after my last one broke. The last few I've bought have all been secondhand. The phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. The one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. I wiped it off and plugged in my phone. Within 5 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. I threw it away and bought a new one. Overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. Also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. The phone came at an 82% battery life.","i ordered this phone after my last one broke. the last few i've bought have all been secondhand. the phone came with a few scratches from all angles, none of which caused any significant issues. the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk. i wiped it off and plugged in my phone. within 5 minutes, i went to pick up my phone, and the charger was burning hot. i threw it away and bought a new one. overall it's worth the price, but don't expect perfection, its quite evidently a used phone that's been scuffed up. also, it comes with something other than the original packing, charger or headphones. the phone came at an 82% battery life.",i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,i ordered this phone after my last one broke the last few ive bought have all been secondhand the phone came with a few scratches from all angles none of which caused any significant issues the one weird thing is that the charger they sent with it was full of some yellow gunk i wiped it off and plugged in my phone within 5 minutes i went to pick up my phone and the charger was burning hot i threw it away and bought a new one overall its worth the price but dont expect perfection its quite evidently a used phone thats been scuffed up also it comes with something other than the original packing charger or headphones the phone came at an 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last ive bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charger sent full yellow gunk wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charger burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone thats scuffed also comes something original packing charger headphones phone came 82 battery life,ordered phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratches angles none caused significant issues one weird thing charge sent full yellow guns wiped plugged phone within 5 minutes went pick phone charge burning hot threw away bought new one overall worth price dont expect perfection quite evidently used phone that stuffed also comes something original packing charge headphones phone came 82 battery life,"['ordered', 'phone', 'last', 'one', 'broke', 'last', 'give', 'bought', 'secondhand', 'phone', 'came', 'scratches', 'angles', 'none', 'caused', 'significant', 'issues', 'one', 'weird', 'thing', 'charge', 'sent', 'full', 'yellow', 'guns', 'wiped', 'plugged', 'phone', 'within', '5', 'minutes', 'went', 'pick', 'phone', 'charge', 'burning', 'hot', 'threw', 'away', 'bought', 'new', 'one', 'overall', 'worth', 'price', 'dont', 'expect', 'perfection', 'quite', 'evidently', 'used', 'phone', 'that', 'stuffed', 'also', 'comes', 'something', 'original', 'packing', 'charge', 'headphones', 'phone', 'came', '82', 'battery', 'life']",order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life,order phone last one broke last give bought secondhand phone came scratch angl none caus signific issu one weird thing charg sent full yellow gun wipe plug phone within 5 minut went pick phone charg burn hot threw away bought new one overal worth price dont expect perfect quit evid use phone that stuf also come someth origin pack charg headphon phone came 82 batteri life
"Overall it’s a great phone. Came in great condition. The bottom right corner barely has a little skuff on it. Barely even noticeable. Both of the cameras work as expected, all the sounds work and it was fully unlocked so I had no problem getting it hooked up to a boost plan. My only complaint is that the battery health is down to 84% which makes charging time a little less than desirable but I’m also not using a fast charger like I’m use to. Overall great phone and quick shipping. I received the phone in 3 days.

"I’ve ordered from this seller a few times now and each time my orders have gotten to me in a very timely manner, this time right before my surgery which is when I needed my new phone, and the past orders had come in with pretty much no cosmetic damage to them at all and looked as if they were brand new.It’s almost the exact same thing with this phone, except this one’s battery life is a lot poorer than the other phones I’ve ordered from this seller and it’s honestly slightly disappointing since the battery on this phone depletes so much quicker than the other phones.  I could be wrong and if so, PLEASE correct me, but 80% I believe is the bare minimum before you’re advised into looking at getting a replacement battery, but I do not have the means or the funds to get a replacement battery, so I just have to make this work since I need this phone and have already gotten rid of my older phone that needed to be outright replaced.Other than this issue, other parts

"For me my biggest worry was the battery life, I was very apprehensive at first but took a shot at it. I received my phone and was shocked to not only see the battery’s capacity was 85% but the great condition the phone came in. With the “good condition” iPhone I expected some noticeable scuffs and scratches but what I received was no where near that, had some scuff near the camera (not on lens) a minuscule almost abysmal scratch on the screen and that’s it. Overall I’m very very happy with my his phone. The quality of the restoration is fantastic. I highly recommend!","for me my biggest worry was the battery life, i was very apprehensive at first but took a shot at it. i received my phone and was shocked to not only see the battery’s capacity was 85% but the great condition the phone came in. with the “good condition” iphone i expected some noticeable scuffs and scratches but what i received was no where near that, had some scuff near the camera (not on lens) a minuscule almost abysmal scratch on the screen and that’s it. overall i’m very very happy with my his phone. the quality of the restoration is fantastic. i highly recommend!",for me my biggest worry was the battery life i was very apprehensive at first but took a shot at it i received my phone and was shocked to not only see the batterys capacity was 85 but the great condition the phone came in with the good condition iphone i expected some noticeable scuffs and scratches but what i received was no where near that had some scuff near the camera not on lens a minuscule almost abysmal scratch on the screen and thats it overall im very very happy with my his phone the quality of the restoration is fantastic i highly recommend,for me my biggest worry was the battery life i was very apprehensive at first but took a shot at it i received my phone and was shocked to not only see the batterys capacity was 85 but the great condition the phone came in with the good condition iphone i expected some noticeable scuffs and scratches but what i received was no where near that had some scuff near the camera not on lens a minuscule almost abysmal scratch on the screen and thats it overall im very very happy with my his phone the quality of the restoration is fantastic i highly recommend,biggest worry battery life apprehensive first took shot received phone shocked see batterys capacity 85 great condition phone came good condition iphone expected noticeable scuffs scratches received near scuff near camera lens minuscule almost abysmal scratch screen thats overall im happy phone quality restoration fantastic highly recommend,biggest worry battery life apprehensive first took shot received phone shocked see battery capacity 85 great condition phone came good condition phone expected noticeable cuffs scratches received near stuff near camera lens minuscule almost abysmal scratch screen that overall in happy phone quality restoration fantastic highly recommend,"['biggest', 'worry', 'battery', 'life', 'apprehensive', 'first', 'took', 'shot', 'received', 'phone', 'shocked', 'see', 'battery', 'capacity', '85', 'great', 'condition', 'phone', 'came', 'good', 'condition', 'phone', 'expected', 'noticeable', 'cuffs', 'scratches', 'received', 'near', 'stuff', 'near', 'camera', 'lens', 'minuscule', 'almost', 'abysmal', 'scratch', 'screen', 'that', 'overall', 'in', 'happy', 'phone', 'quality', 'restoration', 'fantastic', 'highly', 'recommend']",biggest worri batteri life apprehens first took shot receiv phone shock see batteri capac 85 great condit phone came good condit phone expect notic cuff scratch receiv near stuff near camera len minuscul almost abysm scratch screen that overal in happi phone qualiti restor fantast highli recommend,biggest worri batteri life apprehens first took shot receiv phone shock see batteri capac 85 great condit phone came good condit phone expect notic cuff scratch receiv near stuff near camera len minuscul almost abysm scratch screen that overal in happi phone qualiti restor fantast highli recommend
